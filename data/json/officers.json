Khan is a genetically engineered human Augment, a product of the late-20th century Eugenic Wars which saw Earth dominated and almost destroyed.\nAfter being driven from Earth in 1996, Khan and the rest of the surviving Augments drifted through space for almost 300 years. Frozen and unaware, it was by pure chance that they were happened upon by Admiral Marcus of Starfleet. Marcus stole Khan’s identity and wiped away all the memories of his Augment family.\nWhen Khan reclaimed his memories, he killed Admiral Marcus and launched a one-man war on the Federation, only to be defeated by the crew of the USS Enterprise. Since then, Khan has lain dormant, frozen inside a Starfleet holding facility. Starfleet may think itself safe, but no prison can hold Khan Noonien Singh for long.",

Trained as an astromycologist, Stamets sought to shatter conventional thinking around biology and physics. In fact, he did not believe in the concept of biology and physics as separate sciences. He believed in biology as physics. He believed that to truly advance humanity, one needed to transcend traditional wisdom and expand the borders of scientific discovery. \nTo that end, he and his research partner Straal began work on a project - A new technology that would change the galaxy as we know it. Combining astrobiology with astroengineering, they set out to create a new method of space travel, one that would utilize a renewable fuel source to send ships farther than they ever could before, at speeds no-one thought possible. \nUnfortunately, several setbacks would prevent them from reaching their full potential. However, no matter what stands in his way, no matter how many obstacles he needs to surmount, Paul Stamets will never give up on his ultimate goal... To revolutionize scientific exploration and change the galaxy for the better.",

Indeed, he is charming, quick witted and incredibly intelligent but this Mudd has one crucial differentiating factor. There is no line he will not cross.\nThe cruel fate he suffered at the hands of Klingon captors hardened Mudd, turning him ruthless. It showed him that there can be no room for morals in the fight for survival. This new outlook, as well as his penchant for cons and thievery, put him at odds with the crew of the USS Discovery, who have proven to be a mighty thorn in his side.

She was assigned to the USS Enterprise as its department head of the communications section and was directly responsible for communications aboard Starfleet’s flagship vessel.\nHer quick-thinking, diplomatic nature and intelligence won many victories for the Enterprise. Her skillset was so varied that she was even able to man the helm, navigation, and main science station when the need arose.",

Through his tenure as chief engineer, he garnered a well-earned reputation as a “miracle worker” of sorts - when it came to the Enterprise, no issue was too big or too complicated for Scotty to handle.\nA prime authority in his field, Scotty’s knowledge of Constitution-class starships eventually outgrew the knowledge of those who designed them, including Enterprise designer Lawrence “Larry” Marvick.\nA man gifted with a degree of technical skills and expertise rarely paralleled among his counterparts, Scotty is of paramount importance to the makeup of the Enterprise crew. With his arrival in this strange, new timeline, Scotty brings with him a keen sense of curiosity, and a willingness to learn anything he can about his new surroundings.",

At one point in time, they were all individuals with their own unique lives, hopes and aspirations. Two of Ten, known in their former life as Darrohk, was one of those individuals.\n\nAt the height of their military career, Darrohk was a commanding officer aboard the Lhohnu - a shining jewel in the Romulan Star Empire's mining fleet. At one point in time, the Lhohnu oversaw the acquisition of more than twenty percent of the Empire’s entire Dilithium reserves. Specializing in mining expeditions in some of the more tumultuous and dangerous systems in the galaxy, Darrohk and their fellow crew aboard the Lhohnu were a force to be reckoned with in the excavation business.\n\nIt was during one of these fateful runs to an outlying system where Darrohk would first encounter the Borg. The Borg’s attack was swift and merciless, with the entire crew of the Lhohnu apprehended and assimilated into the Collective in a matter of minutes. It wasn’t long until Darrohk, now known as Two of Ten, was assisting the Collective in apprehending and assimilating their former Romulan brothers and sisters.\n\nHowever, Two of Ten’s time in the Collective was to be cut short when, after successfully holding back the Mega Cube, the Romulans were able to liberate them and thousands of other Borg drones from the Collective. While their time in the Collective was brief, they would go on to bear the physical and mental scars of their experiences with the Borg - experiences that would make it impossible to ever resume a normal life. Instead, Two of Ten found solace in Letik and her congregation, and would go on to assist them in their Doomsday plot. Tragically, it was only a matter of time until Two of Ten’s augmented body began to suffer the effects of the reclamation effort. Considered nothing more than a hindrance, they were now abandoned by Letik and her followers.\n\nCastigated by modern Romulan society, and abandoned by Letik and her cabal of Doomsday conspirators, Two of Ten now finds themself alone in a galaxy that has wrought an abundance of hardships upon them. However, this ever-resourceful Romulan will persevere, refusing to buckle under the weight of a fate they never asked for.",

Socialites, artists, leaders. In France, the Dupont name is royalty.\nSo it is fair to say that Raphaël Dupont, second son of esteemed artist Aumier Dupont, had something of an advantage over his peers.\nGiven the best education his father could provide, Raphaël proved to be something of a prodigy of mathematics. His grasp of thermodynamics and theoretical physics would earn him high praise in the academic field. However, he quickly grew bored of the endless stream of peer reviews and university lectures. He found himself enthralled by tales of material miners beyond Federation space. He longed for the danger, the adrenaline, the freedom! But instead, he was stuck on Earth, bound by Federation laws and regulation. He had had enough. It was time for him to forge his own path.\nStealing away one dark night with his family’s prized starship under his possession, he took off beyond the stars, seeking fortune and the adventure of a lifetime.",

Hero. \nJames Tiberius Kirk has been called many things, but most just call him... Captain.\nBorn in Iowa on Earth in 2233, Kirk was raised by his loving parents; George and Winona Kirk. Their teachings, in particular those of his father, inspired a young Kirk to enlist in Starfleet.\nThough he had some blemishes on his record from certain events in the Academy, Kirk proved himself as a reliable man with a noble spirit.\nKirk was a natural leader and quickly climbed the ranks as a Starfleet officer. After a tour of duty aboard the USS Farragut, Kirk found himself assigned to Starfleet’s most prolific vessel; The USS Enterprise. In 2265, at the age of thirty-two, Kirk was granted command of the Enterprise from Captain Pike. It was the proudest day of his father’s life.\nKirk went on to serve with distinction. Under his steadfast leadership, the Enterprise has survived wars, natural disasters, time travel and near galactic destruction. They became legends.\nThroughout it all, Kirk has never lost sight of his childhood dream. To explore, to see new worlds and meet new civilizations... To boldly go, where no-one has gone before.",

Where Khan was equal parts calculating and raw fury, Navi was compassionate and calm.

He had become consumed by rage and his desire for vengeance. Only she could pull him back from the brink of darkness.\nOf course, she is still willing to bend the rules as necessary, if it means that she can better serve Khan and her Augment family, so long as it does not involve cruelty or unnecessary violence.\nThough she finds herself in a strange, hostile galaxy, she is determined to hold on to her most precious possession… Her kind heart.",

Since then, Jaylah has committed herself to studying at Starfleet Academy. Despite her lack of social graces, she has proven herself to be a mechanic and fighter without equal among her fellow students. Her bravery, ferocity and unwavering determination will ensure a bright future wherever it takes her.",

Liar and rogue. He goes by many pejoratives, but perhaps the most accurate of them all is opportunist. For years, Mudd has made a living by trying to con and extort everyone he’s ever met. \nThough he always gives different accounts of where he came from, one element of his story always remains the same: his claims to have faced injustices that many will never know. With that chip on his shoulder, he believes in taking what he wants, and doing whatever necessary to get ahead. Whether it’s ships, weapons, creatures, - as long as he can sell it, he will try to steal it!\nAfter the Borg laid waste to the galaxy, Mudd saw an opening to build his own criminal empire. After all, who was going to stop him? With all the major factions rebuilding and healing, Mudd knows that now was the time to strike. However, with his new ambitions comes more notoriety. And more notoriety means more targets on his back.",

A man of two worlds.\n\nWorf, son of Mogh, is a Klingon warrior and Starfleet officer. At a young age, Worf lived on the Khitomer colony, which was eventually attacked by Romulan forces, leaving him orphaned. Luckily, he was rescued by a Federation vessel, the USS Intrepid, where he was adopted by the Rozhenko family. Worf grew up surrounded by humans, but kept close ties to his ancestral home. As the first of his kind to ever serve in Starfleet, he has constantly faced ridicule and rejection from fellow Klingons. Worf fights twice as hard for his honor, and has become a battle-sharpened edge as a result.\n\nWorf’s place as Chief Security aboard the Enterprise came after a stint as conn officer. He regularly reports to away team duty as the front line of defense for the landing party.

If that is indeed the case, then Captain Kirk can rest easy knowing that his First Officer is one of the finest in the galaxy.\nSpock, a given name as his full name is unpronounceable to humans, is a human/Vulcan hybrid born on Vulcan in 2230. His hybrid status caused him no shortage of pain in his childhood, but the love of his mother and the wisdom of his father allowed him to overcome his aggressors.\nA prodigy even by Vulcan standards, Spock was destined for greatness. He was even granted a place in the prestigious Vulcan Science Academy, which he declined in favor of Starfleet.\nHe was granted a place on the Enterprise, where he served as Captain Pike’s Science Officer. He forged a close relationship with his Captain and was intended to eventually take over command of the vessel.\nHowever, through a series of unexpected events, command of the Enterprise went to James T. Kirk, a result which neither pleased nor disappointed Spock. Command simply exists, and he will do whatever is logical.\nWith Spock’s sage wisdom and unshakeable composure, he was able to guide the Enterprise and its Captain through their many trials.",
