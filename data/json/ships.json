The key to Discovery's military success was its unique spore drive, which allowed it to travel galactic distances in the blink of an eye.\nThis incredible technology made Discovery invaluable to Starfleet's war efforts and its captain was given virtually limitless resources and jurisdiction to fight the war as he saw fit.
