##Notes
The files contained are ready from stfc.space's api access into api.stfc.dev ... looks like the api uses some strong cors handshakes to ensure the data can only be accessed from certain sources.

* **WARNING** the materials.json is HUGE, my ide can not even parse it.

All this data was pulled in the following manner

https://api.stfc.dev/v1/resource?version=669164b51266bd5a7e33b867d11cbff62a44eb0573342d4f1682a7a0b672c1bc&n=1208449541

* https://api.stfc.dev/v1/
> Base URL
* resource
> This is the resource being asked for.  These resources are in the individual files in the json directory
* version=669164b51266bd5a7e33b867d11cbff62a44eb0573342d4f1682a7a0b672c1bc
> this appears to be an access token for stfc.space however due to the cors restrictions this could just be a UUID for the current build generated by a backend process, but it is the same key on all the requests
* n=1208449541
